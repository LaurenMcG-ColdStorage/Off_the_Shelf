                Here at Off the Shelf, we have a pretty simple policy when it comes to your data:<br /><br />
                We do our best to take in as little data as possible. 
                If we don't need it in order to let you 
                use our app, then we don't want to hold onto it.
                We also won't use or sell what little 
                information we do hold to advertisers or anyone else.<br /><br />
                You're here to have fun nerding out, not to worry about where your data is going.
            </p>
